# STLINK-V3-BRIDGE_libusb

STLINK-V3-BRIDGE API which does not uses the ST's libSTLinkUSBDriver but uses libusb.

Built for validation purposes but mightbe useful in the case if you want to use the STLINK-V3-BRIDGE API on a non x86 platform (like Raspberry PI).

qmake based buildsystem needed to compile it. 

I am open for PRs adding automake/cmake based build setup.
